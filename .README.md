# Polymet Case Study UI

This is a case study UI for Polymet. It is built with Next.js, Shadcn UI, Clerk, and Tailwind CSS.
It's far from being complete and/or functional. I unfortunately didn't have time to finish it.

## How to run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### UI/UX Decisions

I wanted to keep the UI simple and clean. I used Shadcn UI for the components and Tailwind CSS for the styling.
The expected UX is similar to v0 and all the other LLMs that are out there. I feel like it's a good starting point and is a proven UX.

- User is able to view their designs/chats in the sidebar and create new ones from the sidebar using the plus button.
- When user lands on the app, if they dont have a design, they are prompted to create one via a guided tutorial.
- When user clicks on a design, they are taken to the design page.
- On the design page, user can view the design, chat with the design, and view the design's settings.
- Individual design pages are going to be very similar to v0, where on the left side user can chat and iterate on the design. On the right side user can view the design and its code.

### Design Creation Process

- User is prompted to enter a GitHub repo URL.
- User is prompted to select a path to the code they want to design.
- After the design is created, user is taken to the design page. We will have a loading state that shows the user the progress of the creation event.
I'd love to use something like https://ui.aceternity.com/components/multi-step-loader to show the user the progress of the creation event. (In this process, we will call the bundler API and try to get the code ready for the initial design.)
